Testing hardware with arduino (i.e. NFC)

1.) copy (or link) all folders in libraries into arduino IDE library path
2.) open *.ino file
3.) upload 

Libraries are copied from:

* PN532: github.com/awieser/PN532 forked from github.com/Seeed-Studio/PN532 

If you update the library from PN532, please make sure to disable debug output in PN532_debug.h.
